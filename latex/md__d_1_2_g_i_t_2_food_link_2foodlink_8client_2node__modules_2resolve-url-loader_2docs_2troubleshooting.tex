Webpack is difficult to configure simply because it is so powerful. If you face a problem it is important to raise it in the right place.

Possibly whatever problem you are facing is {\itshape not} an issue with this loader, so please work this list before raising an issue.

{\bfseries{Working with a framework}}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Check to see if that framework is still using an older version with the {\ttfamily rework} engine. This will not support modern CSS and is the source of most problems. Usually there is an existing issue raised in that framework and there may be workarounds there.
\item Hack the framework code in your {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} to diagose the root cause.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\bfseries{Creating your own webpack config}}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Do the checklist at the top of the page -\/ do you {\itshape need} to use this loader?
\item Read and understand the detail on \doxysectlink{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2how-it-works}{how the loader works}{0}.
\item Check the known-\/issues below.
\item Use the {\ttfamily debug} option to see where the loader is looking for your assets.
\item Temporarily remove this loader and use non-\/relative asset paths to check if the problem is something else.
\item Check \href{http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=resolve-url-loader}{\texttt{ stack overflow}} for an answer.
\item Review \href{/issues?utf8=\%E2\%9C\%93&q=is\%3Aissue}{\texttt{ previous issues}} that may be similar.
\item Try to recreate the problem with a minimum breaking example project.

I\textquotesingle{}m happy this loader helps so many people. Open-\/source is provided as-\/is and I\textquotesingle{}m currently {\bfseries{not}} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food}{\texttt{ dogfooding}} this loader in my own work, so please try not project your frustrations. There are some really great people who follow this project who can help.\hypertarget{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17497}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Known issues}{Known issues}}\label{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17497}
\hypertarget{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17498}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Support for {\ttfamily image-\/set()}}{Support for {\ttfamily image-\/set()}}}\label{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17498}
Right now this loader only rewrites {\ttfamily url()} statements.

If you need other statements processed, such as {\ttfamily image-\/set()}, then please upvote \href{issues/119}{\texttt{ issue \#119}}.\hypertarget{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17499}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Absolute URIs}{Absolute URIs}}\label{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17499}
By "{}absolute URIs"{} we more correctly mean assets with root-\/relative URLs or absolute file paths. These paths are {\bfseries{not}} processed unless a {\ttfamily root} is specified.

However any paths that {\itshape are} processed will have windows back-\/slash converted to posix forward-\/slash. This can be useful since some webpack loaders can choke on windows paths. By using `root\+: '\textquotesingle{}{\ttfamily then}resolve-\/url-\/loader\`{} effectively does nothing to absolute paths except change the windows backslash.

{\bfseries{ðŸ’¡ Protip}} In {\bfseries{windows}} if your downstream loaders are choking on windows paths using `root\+: '\textquotesingle{}\`{} can help.

Also it be useful to process absolute URIs if you have a custom {\ttfamily join} function and want to process all the paths. Although this is perhaps better done with some separate {\ttfamily postcss} plugin.\hypertarget{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17500}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Windows line breaks}{Windows line breaks}}\label{md__d_1_2_g_i_t_2_food_link_2foodlink_8client_2node__modules_2resolve-url-loader_2docs_2troubleshooting_autotoc_md17500}
Normal windows linebreaks are {\ttfamily CRLF}. But sometimes libsass will output single {\ttfamily CR} characters.

This problem is specific to multiline declarations. Refer to the \href{https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2693}{\texttt{ libsass bug \#2693}}.

If you have {\itshape any} such multiline declarations preceding {\ttfamily url()} statements it will fail your build.

Libsass doesn\textquotesingle{}t consider these orphan {\ttfamily CR} to be newlines but {\ttfamily postcss} engine does. The result being an offset in source-\/map line-\/numbers which crashes {\ttfamily resolve-\/url-\/loader}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

Some users find the node-\/sass {\ttfamily linefeed} option solves the problem.

{\bfseries{Solutions}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Try the node-\/sass \href{https://github.com/sass/node-sass\#linefeed--v300}{\texttt{ linefeed}} option by way of {\ttfamily sass-\/loader}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Work arounds}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enable {\ttfamily remove\+CR} option \href{../README.md\#options}{\texttt{ here}} (enabled by default on Window OS).
\item Remove linebreaks in declarations in your {\ttfamily .scss} sources.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Diagnosis}}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run a stand-\/alone sass build {\ttfamily npx node-\/sass index.\+scss output.\+css}.
\item Use a hex editor to check line endings {\ttfamily Format-\/\+Hex output.\+css}.
\item Expect {\ttfamily 0DOA} (or desired) line endings. Single {\ttfamily 0D} confirms this problem.
