Webpack plugin for enabling Subresource Integrity.

\href{http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/}{\texttt{ Subresource Integrity}} (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that files they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation.

For the plugin to take effect it is {\bfseries{essential}} that you set the {\ttfamily integrity} attribute for top-\/level assets (i.\+e. assets loaded by your HTML pages.)\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22136}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{With Html\+Webpack\+Plugin}{With Html\+Webpack\+Plugin}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22136}
When html-\/webpack-\/plugin is injecting assets into the template (the default), the {\ttfamily integrity} attribute will be set automatically. The {\ttfamily crossorigin} attribute will be set as well, to the value of {\ttfamily output.\+cross\+Origin\+Loading} webpack option. There is nothing else to be done.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22137}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{With Html\+Webpack\+Plugin(\{ inject\+: false \})}{With Html\+Webpack\+Plugin(\{ inject\+: false \})}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22137}
When you use html-\/webpack-\/plugin with {\ttfamily inject\+: false}, you are required to set the {\ttfamily integrity} and {\ttfamily crossorigin} attributes in your template as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{<\%\ for\ (let\ index\ in\ htmlWebpackPlugin.files.js)\ \{\ \%>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ <script}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ src="{}<\%=\ htmlWebpackPlugin.files.js[index]\ \%>"{}}

The correct value for the {\ttfamily integrity} attribute can be retrieved from the {\ttfamily integrity} property of Webpack assets. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{compiler.plugin("{}done"{},\ (stats)\ =>\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ const\ integrityValues\ =\ stats}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ .toJson()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ .assets.map((asset)\ =>\ [asset.name,\ asset.integrity]);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that when you add the {\ttfamily integrity} attribute on your {\ttfamily link} and {\ttfamily script} tags, you\textquotesingle{}re also required to set the {\ttfamily crossorigin} attribute. It is recommended to set this attribute to the same value as the webpack {\ttfamily output.\+cross\+Origin\+Loading} configuration option.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22139}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Web Server Configuration}{Web Server Configuration}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22139}
If your page can be loaded through plain HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS), you must set the {\ttfamily Cache-\/\+Control\+: no-\/transform} response header or your page will break when assets are loaded through a transforming proxy. See below for more information.

When using caching, stale assets will fail to load since they will not pass integrity checks. It is vital that you configure caching correctly in your web server. See below for more information.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22140}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Options}{Options}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22140}

Default value\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{[}"{}sha384"{}\mbox{]}}

An array of strings, each specifying the name of a hash function to be used for calculating integrity hash values.

See \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/\#cryptographic-hash-functions}{\texttt{ SRI\+: Cryptographic hash functions}}

The default is chosen based on the current \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-SRI-20160623/\#hash-collision-attacks}{\texttt{ suggestion by the W3C}} which reads\+:

\begin{quote}
At the time of writing, SHA-\/384 is a good baseline. \end{quote}


See \href{https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/issues/477}{\texttt{ here}} for additional information on why SHA-\/384 was chosen by the W3C over their initial suggestion, SHA-\/256.

As one of the commenters in that discussion points out, "{}\+SRI hashes are likely delivered over SSL"{} which today (2021) is often using SHA-\/256 so that there is probably little harm in downgrading this to {\ttfamily sha256} instead.

By using SHA-\/256 you will save 21 bytes per chunk and perhaps a few CPU cycles, although SHA-\/384 is actually faster to compute on some hardware. Not that it matters, as the difference is dwarfed by all the other work a browser has to do in order to download and parse a JS or CSS asset.

You probably want to use {\ttfamily sha512} instead of the default only if you\textquotesingle{}re paranoid. It will cost you an additional 21 bytes per chunk; the CPU overhead is virtually nil because SHA-\/512 is the same as SHA-\/384, just not truncated.

Although you can specify multiple hash functions here, doing so is pointless as long as all mainstream browsers only support the SHA-\/2 family, which is the case today. Worse, it\textquotesingle{}s detrimental since it adds unnecessary overhead.

The reason is that as per the spec, only the strongest hash function is used and so eg. `\mbox{[}\textquotesingle{}sha256', \textquotesingle{}sha512\textquotesingle{}\mbox{]}{\ttfamily is equivalent to}\mbox{[}\textquotesingle{}sha512\textquotesingle{}\mbox{]}\`{} unless SHA-\/512 was one day deemed {\itshape weaker} than SHA-\/256 by user agents, which is an unlikely scenario. As one of the authors of the W3C spec \href{https://github.com/mozilla/srihash.org/issues/155\#issuecomment-259800503}{\texttt{ puts it}}\+:

\begin{quote}
The support for multiple hashes is in the spec for backward-\/compatibility once we introduce new hash algorithms (e.\+g. SHA3). \end{quote}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22142}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{enabled}{enabled}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22142}
Default value\+: {\ttfamily "{}auto"{}}

One of {\ttfamily "{}auto"{}}, {\ttfamily true}, or {\ttfamily false}.

{\ttfamily true} means to enable the plugin and {\ttfamily false} means to disable it.

{\ttfamily auto} is the default and means to enable the plugin when the \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/}{\texttt{ Webpack mode}} is {\ttfamily production} or {\ttfamily none} and disable it when it is {\ttfamily development}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22143}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{hash\+Loading}{hash\+Loading}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22143}
Default value\+: {\ttfamily "{}eager"{}}

One of {\ttfamily "{}eager"{}} or {\ttfamily "{}lazy"{}}

{\ttfamily "{}eager"{}"{}$<$/tt$>$ means that integrity hashes for all assets will be defined in the entry chunk.  $<$tt$>$"{}lazy"{}$<$/tt$>$ means that integrity hashes for any given asset will be defined in its direct parents  in the chunk graph. This can lead to duplication of hashes across assets, but can significantly reduce the size of your entry chunk(s) if you have a large number of async chunks.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md22144 Exporting $<$tt$>$integrity$<$/tt$>$ values  \+You might want to export generated integrity hashes, perhaps for use with SSR. We recommend $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/webdeveric/webpack-assets-manifest}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/webdeveric/webpack-\/assets-\/manifest}}"{} $>$webpack-\/assets-\/manifest$<$/a$>$ for this purpose. When configured with option $<$tt$>$integrity\+: true$<$/tt$>$ it will include the hashes generated by this plugin in the manifest.  $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/tree/main/examples/webpack-assets-manifest/}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/waysact/webpack-\/subresource-\/integrity/tree/main/examples/webpack-\/assets-\/manifest/}}"{} $>$\+Example usage with webpack-\/assets-\/manifest$<$/a$>$.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md22145 Caveats  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22146 Caching  \+Using SRI presents a potential risk to the availability of your website when \+HTTP response caching is setup incorrectly. Stale asset versions are always problematic but SRI exacerbates the risk.  \+Without SRI, inconsequential changes (such as whitespace-\/only changes) don\textquotesingle{}t matter, and your website might still look OK when a stale CSS asset is used. \+Even with a stale JS asset there\textquotesingle{}s a chance your website will still be more or less working as expected.  \+With SRI, however, a stale asset will fail hard. This is because the browser won\textquotesingle{}t tell the difference between a version of your asset that has been tampered with and one that is simply outdated\+: both will fail the integrity check and refuse to load.  \+It\textquotesingle{}s therefore imperative that, if you do use caching, you use a robust setup\+: one where $<$em$>$any$<$/em$>$ change in content, no matter how miniscule or inconsequential, will cause the cache to be invalidated.  \+With Webpack and long-\/term caching this means using $<$tt$>$\mbox{[}contenthash\mbox{]}$<$/tt$>$ (with $<$tt$>$real\+Content\+Hash$<$/tt$>$, which is enabled by default in production mode). Using $<$tt$>$\mbox{[}contenthash\mbox{]}$<$/tt$>$ with $<$tt$>$real\+Content\+Hash$<$/tt$>$ disabled, or using a different type of hash placeholder (such as $<$tt$>$\mbox{[}chunkhash\mbox{]}$<$/tt$>$) provides weaker guarantees, which is why this plugin will output a warning in these cases. See $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/issues/162}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/waysact/webpack-\/subresource-\/integrity/issues/162}}"{}  $>$issue \#162$<$/a$>$ for more information.  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22147 Proxies  \+By its very nature, SRI can cause your page to break when assets are modified by a proxy. This is because SRI doesn\textquotesingle{}t distinguish between malicious and benevolent modifications\+: any modification will prevent an asset from being loaded.  \+Notably, this issue can arise when your page is loaded through $<$a href="{}\href{https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/data-compression}{\texttt{ https\+://developer.\+chrome.\+com/multidevice/data-\/compression}}"{} $>$\+Chrome Data Saver$<$/a$>$.  \+This is only a problem when your page can be loaded with plain HTTP, since proxies are incapable of modifying encrypted HTTPS responses.  \+Presumably, you\textquotesingle{}re looking to use SRI because you\textquotesingle{}re concerned about security and thus your page is only served through HTTPS anyway. \+However, if you really need to use SRI and HTTP together, you should set the $<$tt$>$\+Cache-\/\+Control\+: no-\/transform$<$/tt$>$ response header. This will instruct all well-\/behaved proxies (including Chrome Data Saver) to refrain from modifying the assets.  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22148 Preloading  \+This plugin adds the integrity attribute to $<$tt$>$\textbackslash{}$<$link rel="{}preload"{}\textbackslash{}$>$$<$/tt$>$ tags, but preloading with SRI doesn\textquotesingle{}t work as expected in current \+Chrome versions. The resource will be loaded twice, defeating the purpose of preloading. This problem doesn\textquotesingle{}t appear to exist in \+Firefox or Safari. See $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/waysact/webpack-subresource-integrity/issues/111}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/waysact/webpack-\/subresource-\/integrity/issues/111}}"{}  $>$issue \#111$<$/a$>$ for more information.  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22149 Browser support  \+Browser support for SRI is widely implemented. Your page will still work on browsers without support for SRI, but subresources won\textquotesingle{}t be protected from tampering.  \+See $<$a href="{}\href{http://caniuse.com/\#feat=subresource-integrity}{\texttt{ http\+://caniuse.\+com/\#feat=subresource-\/integrity}}"{} $>$\+Can I use Subresource Integrity?$<$/a$>$  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22150 Hot Reloading  \+This plugin can interfere with hot reloading and therefore should be disabled when using tools such as $<$tt$>$webpack-\/dev-\/server$<$/tt$>$. This shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be a problem because hot reloading is usually used only in development mode where SRI is not normally needed.  \+For testing SRI without setting up a full-\/blown web server, consider using a tool such as $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/indexzero/http-server}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/indexzero/http-\/server}}"{} $>$$<$tt$>$http-\/server$<$/tt$>$$<$/a$>$.  @subsubsection autotoc\+\_\+md22151 Safari and Assets that Require Cookies  \+As detailed in $<$a href="{}\href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6972}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/webpack/webpack/issues/6972}}"{} $>$\+Webpack Issue \#6972$<$/a$>$, the $<$tt$>$cross\+Origin$<$/tt$>$ attribute can break loading of assets in certain edge cases due to a bug in Safari. Since SRI requires the $<$tt$>$cross\+Origin$<$/tt$>$ attribute to be set, you may run into this case even when source URL is same-\/origin with respect to the asset.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md22152 Further Reading  -\/ $<$a href="{}\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity}{\texttt{ https\+://developer.\+mozilla.\+org/en-\/\+US/docs/\+Web/\+Security/\+Subresource\+\_\+\+Integrity}}"{} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}MDN\+: Subresource Integrity}
