\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Get the list of files installed in a package in node\+\_\+modules, including bundled dependencies.

This is useful if you want to remove a package node from the tree {\itshape without} removing its child nodes, for example to extract a new version of the dependency into place safely.

It\textquotesingle{}s sort of the reflection of \href{http://npm.im/npm-packlist}{\texttt{ npm-\/packlist}}, but for listing out the {\itshape installed} files rather than the files that {\itshape will} be installed. This is of course a much simpler operation, because we don\textquotesingle{}t have to handle ignore files or package.\+json {\ttfamily files} lists.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1602}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{USAGE}{USAGE}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1602}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily depth} Number, default {\ttfamily 1}. How deep to traverse through folders to get contents. Typically you\textquotesingle{}d want to set this to either {\ttfamily 1} (to get the surface files and folders) or {\ttfamily Infinity} (to get all files), but any other positive number is supported as well. If set to {\ttfamily 0} or a negative number, returns the path provided and (if it is a package) its set of linked bins.
\item {\ttfamily path} Required. Path to the package in {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} where traversal should begin.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1604}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{RETURN VALUE}{RETURN VALUE}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1604}
A Promise that resolves to an array of fully-\/resolved files and folders matching the criteria. This includes all bundled dependencies in {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules}, and any linked executables in {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules/.bin} that the package caused to be installed.

An empty or missing package folder will return an empty array. Empty directories {\itshape within} package contents are listed, even if the {\ttfamily depth} argument would cause them to be traversed into.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1605}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{CAVEAT}{CAVEAT}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1605}
If using this module to generate a list of files that should be recursively removed to clear away the package, note that this will leave empty directories behind in certain cases\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If all child packages are bundled dependencies, then the {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} folder will remain.
\item If all child packages within a given scope were bundled dependencies, then the {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules/@scope} folder will remain.
\item If all linked bin scripts were removed, then an empty {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules/.bin} folder will remain.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In the interest of speed and algorithmic complexity, this module does {\itshape not} do a subsequent readdir to see if it would remove all directory entries, though it would be easier to look at if it returned {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} or {\ttfamily .bin} in that case rather than the contents. However, if the intent is to pass these arguments to {\ttfamily rimraf}, it hardly makes sense to do {\itshape two} {\ttfamily readdir} calls just so that we can have the luxury of having to make a third.

Since the primary use case is to delete a package\textquotesingle{}s contents so that they can be re-\/filled with a new version of that package, this caveat does not pose a problem. Empty directories are already ignored by both npm and git.
