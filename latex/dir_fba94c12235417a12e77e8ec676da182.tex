\doxysubsubsection*{Introduction}

Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle Java\+Script files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

{\bfseries{TL;DR}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bundles \href{https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html}{\texttt{ ES Modules}}, \href{http://wiki.commonjs.org/}{\texttt{ Common\+JS}}, and \href{https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD}{\texttt{ AMD}} modules (even combined).
\item Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
\item Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
\item Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.\+g. Type\+Script to Java\+Script, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
\item Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

Webpack supports all browsers that are \href{https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/}{\texttt{ ES5-\/compliant}} (IE8 and below are not supported). Webpack also needs {\ttfamily Promise} for {\ttfamily import()} and {\ttfamily require.\+ensure()}. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to \href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/}{\texttt{ load a polyfill}} before using these expressions.

Webpack has a \href{https://webpack.js.org/plugins/}{\texttt{ rich plugin interface}}. Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very {\bfseries{flexible}}.

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle {\bfseries{any static resource}} way beyond Java\+Script. You can easily \href{https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/}{\texttt{ write your own loaders}} using Node.\+js.

Loaders are activated by using {\ttfamily loadername!} prefixes in {\ttfamily require()} statements, or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22360}{}\doxysubsubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Files}{Files}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22360}

Webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast and incredibly {\bfseries{fast}} on incremental compilations.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22367}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Module Formats}{Module Formats}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22367}
Webpack supports ES2015+, Common\+JS and AMD modules {\bfseries{out of the box}}. It performs clever static analysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to {\bfseries{support most existing libraries}} out of the box.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22368}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/}{\texttt{ Code Splitting}}}{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/}{\texttt{ Code Splitting}}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22368}
Webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22369}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/}{\texttt{ Optimizations}}}{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/}{\texttt{ Optimizations}}}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22369}
Webpack can do many optimizations to {\bfseries{reduce the output size of your Java\+Script}} by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting. It can also make your code chunks {\bfseries{cache friendly}} by using hashes.

\doxysubsubsection*{Contributing}

{\bfseries{We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.}} We have a \href{https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home}{\texttt{ vibrant ecosystem}} that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in \href{https://github.com/webpack}{\texttt{ our organization}} or \href{https://github.com/webpack-contrib}{\texttt{ webpack-\/contrib organization}} which houses all of our loaders and plugins.

Contributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org}{\texttt{ Documentation}} updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes
\item Spelling or grammar fixes
\item README.\+md corrections or redesigns
\item Adding unit, or functional tests
\item Triaging Git\+Hub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.
\item \href{https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack}{\texttt{ Searching \#webpack on twitter}} and helping someone else who needs help
\item Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack\textquotesingle{}s repos!
\item \href{https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack}{\texttt{ Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials}} about one of webpack\textquotesingle{}s many features.
\item Helping others in our webpack \href{https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack}{\texttt{ gitter channel}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To get started have a look at our \href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md}{\texttt{ documentation on contributing}}.

If you are worried or don\textquotesingle{}t know where to start, you can {\bfseries{always}} reach out to \href{https://twitter.com/thelarkinn}{\texttt{ Sean Larkin (@\+The\+Lark\+Inn) on Twitter}} or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!

We have also started a series on our \href{https://medium.com/webpack}{\texttt{ Medium Publication}} called \href{https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home}{\texttt{ The Contributor\textquotesingle{}s Guide to webpack}}. We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.

{\itshape Looking to speak about webpack?} We\textquotesingle{}d {\bfseries{love}} to review your talk abstract/\+CFP! You can email it to webpack \mbox{[}at\mbox{]} opencollective \mbox{[}dot\mbox{]} com and we can give pointers or tips!!!

\doxysubsubsubsection*{Creating your own plugins and loaders}

If you create a loader or plugin, we would \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the \`{}x-\/loader\`{}, \`{}x-\/webpack-\/plugin\`{} naming convention.

\doxysubsubsection*{Support}

We consider webpack to be a low-\/level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn\textquotesingle{}t always the {\itshape easiest} entry-\/level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we\textquotesingle{}re always looking for ways to improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we\textquotesingle{}re all ears!

If you\textquotesingle{}re just getting started, take a look at \href{https://webpack.js.org/concepts/}{\texttt{ our new docs and concepts page}}. This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!

Looking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old \href{https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents}{\texttt{ wiki}}, but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.

If you want to discuss something or just need help, \href{https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack}{\texttt{ here is our Gitter room}} where there are always individuals looking to help out!

If you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post a question to \href{https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack}{\texttt{ Stack\+Overflow with the webpack tag}}. It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.\+config.\+js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we\textquotesingle{}d be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)

If you are twitter savvy you can tweet \#webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.

If you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md22370}{}\doxysubsubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md22370}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/google}{\texttt{ @google}} for \href{http://www.gwtproject.org/}{\texttt{ Google Web Toolkit (GWT)}}, which aims to compile Java to Java\+Script. It features a similar \href{http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html}{\texttt{ Code Splitting}} as webpack.
\item \href{https://github.com/medikoo}{\texttt{ @medikoo}} for \href{https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake}{\texttt{ modules-\/webmake}}, which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-\/webmake. Interestingly the \href{https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7}{\texttt{ Code Splitting issue is still open}} (thanks also to @\+Phoscur for the discussion).
\item \href{https://github.com/substack}{\texttt{ @substack}} for \href{https://browserify.org/}{\texttt{ browserify}}, which is a similar project and source for many ideas.
\item \href{https://github.com/jrburke}{\texttt{ @jrburke}} for \href{https://requirejs.org/}{\texttt{ require.\+js}}, which is a similar project and source for many ideas.
\item \href{https://github.com/defunctzombie}{\texttt{ @defunctzombie}} for the \href{https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec}{\texttt{ browser-\/field spec}}, which makes modules available for node.\+js, browserify and webpack.
\item Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or PRs. You influenced the direction...
\item \href{https://github.com/shama}{\texttt{ @shama}}, \href{https://github.com/jhnns}{\texttt{ @jhnns}} and \href{https://github.com/sokra}{\texttt{ @sokra}} for maintaining this project
\item Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...
\item Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.
