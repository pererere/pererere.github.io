{\ttfamily pacote} works with any kind of package specifier that npm can install. If you can pass it to the npm CLI, you can pass it to pacote. (In fact, that\textquotesingle{}s exactly what the npm CLI does.)

Anything that you can do with one kind of package, you can do with another.

Data that isn\textquotesingle{}t relevant (like a packument for a tarball) will be simulated.

{\ttfamily prepare} scripts will be run when generating tarballs from {\ttfamily git} and {\ttfamily directory} locations, to simulate what {\itshape would} be published to the registry, so that you get a working package instead of just raw source code that might need to be transpiled.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15877}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{CLI}{CLI}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15877}
This module exports a command line interface that can do most of what is described below. Run {\ttfamily pacote -\/h} to learn more.

The {\ttfamily spec} refers to any kind of package specifier that npm can install. If you can pass it to the npm CLI, you can pass it to pacote. (In fact, that\textquotesingle{}s exactly what the npm CLI does.)

See below for valid {\ttfamily opts} values.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+resolve(spec, opts)} Resolve a specifier like {\ttfamily foo@latest} or {\ttfamily github\+:user/project} all the way to a tarball url, tarball file, or git repo with commit hash.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+extract(spec, dest, opts)} Extract a package\textquotesingle{}s tarball into a destination folder. Returns a promise that resolves to the {\ttfamily \{from,resolved,integrity\}} of the extracted package.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+manifest(spec, opts)} Fetch (or simulate) a package\textquotesingle{}s manifest (basically, the {\ttfamily package.\+json} file, plus a bit of metadata). See below for more on manifests and packuments. Returns a Promise that resolves to the manifest object.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+packument(spec, opts)} Fetch (or simulate) a package\textquotesingle{}s packument (basically, the top-\/level package document listing all the manifests that the registry returns). See below for more on manifests and packuments. Returns a Promise that resolves to the packument object.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+tarball(spec, opts)} Get a package tarball data as a buffer in memory. Returns a Promise that resolves to the tarball data Buffer, with {\ttfamily from}, {\ttfamily resolved}, and {\ttfamily integrity} fields attached.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+tarball.\+file(spec, dest, opts)} Save a package tarball data to a file on disk. Returns a Promise that resolves to {\ttfamily \{from,integrity,resolved\}} of the fetched tarball.
\item {\ttfamily pacote.\+tarball.\+stream(spec, stream\+Handler, opts)} Fetch a tarball and make the stream available to the {\ttfamily stream\+Handler} function.

This is mostly an internal function, but it is exposed because it does provide some functionality that may be difficult to achieve otherwise.

The {\ttfamily stream\+Handler} function MUST return a Promise that resolves when the stream (and all associated work) is ended, or rejects if the stream has an error.

The {\ttfamily stream\+Handler} function MAY be called multiple times, as Pacote retries requests in some scenarios, such as cache corruption or retriable network failures.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15879}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Options}{Options}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15879}
Options are passed to \href{http://npm.im/npm-registry-fetch}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily npm-\/registry-\/fetch}}} and \href{http://npm.im/cacache}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cacache}}}, so in addition to these, anything for those modules can be given to pacote as well.

Options object is cloned, and mutated along the way to add integrity, resolved, and other properties, as they are determined.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cache} Where to store cache entries and temp files. Passed to \href{http://npm.im/cacache}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cacache}}}. Defaults to the same cache directory that npm will use by default, based on platform and environment.
\item {\ttfamily where} Base folder for resolving relative {\ttfamily file\+:} dependencies.
\item {\ttfamily resolved} Shortcut for looking up resolved values. Should be specified if known.
\item {\ttfamily integrity} Expected integrity of fetched package tarball. If specified, tarballs with mismatched integrity values will raise an {\ttfamily EINTEGRITY} error.
\item {\ttfamily umask} Permission mode mask for extracted files and directories. Defaults to {\ttfamily 0o22}. See "{}\+Extracted File Modes"{} below.
\item {\ttfamily fmode} Minimum permission mode for extracted files. Defaults to {\ttfamily 0o666}. See "{}\+Extracted File Modes"{} below.
\item {\ttfamily dmode} Minimum permission mode for extracted directories. Defaults to {\ttfamily 0o777}. See "{}\+Extracted File Modes"{} below.
\item {\ttfamily prefer\+Online} Prefer to revalidate cache entries, even when it would not be strictly necessary. Default {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\ttfamily before} When picking a manifest from a packument, only consider packages published before the specified date. Default {\ttfamily null}.
\item {\ttfamily default\+Tag} The default {\ttfamily dist-\/tag} to use when choosing a manifest from a packument. Defaults to {\ttfamily latest}.
\item {\ttfamily registry} The npm registry to use by default. Defaults to {\ttfamily \href{https://registry.npmjs.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://registry.\+npmjs.\+org/}}}.
\item {\ttfamily full\+Metadata} Fetch the full metadata from the registry for packuments, including information not strictly required for installation (author, description, etc.) Defaults to {\ttfamily true} when {\ttfamily before} is set, since the version publish time is part of the extended packument metadata.
\item {\ttfamily full\+Read\+Json} Use the slower {\ttfamily read-\/package-\/json} package insted of {\ttfamily read-\/package-\/json-\/fast} in order to include extra fields like "{}readme"{} in the manifest. Defaults to {\ttfamily false}.
\item {\ttfamily packument\+Cache} For registry packuments only, you may provide a {\ttfamily Map} object which will be used to cache packument requests between pacote calls. This allows you to easily avoid hitting the registry multiple times (even just to validate the cache) for a given packument, since it is unlikely to change in the span of a single command.
\item {\ttfamily silent} A boolean that determines whether the banner is displayed when calling {\ttfamily @npmcli/run-\/script}.
\item {\ttfamily verify\+Signatures} A boolean that will make pacote verify the integrity signature of a manifest, if present. There must be a configured {\ttfamily \+\_\+keys} entry in the config that is scoped to the registry the manifest is being fetched from.
\item {\ttfamily verify\+Attestations} A boolean that will make pacote verify Sigstore attestations, if present. There must be a configured {\ttfamily \+\_\+keys} entry in the config that is scoped to the registry the manifest is being fetched from.
\item {\ttfamily tuf\+Cache} Where to store metadata/target files when retrieving the package attestation key material via TUF. Defaults to the same cache directory that npm will use by default, based on platform and environment.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15880}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Advanced API}{Advanced API}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15880}
Each different type of fetcher is exposed for more advanced usage such as using helper methods from this classes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Dir\+Fetcher}
\item {\ttfamily File\+Fetcher}
\item {\ttfamily Git\+Fetcher}
\item {\ttfamily Registry\+Fetcher}
\item {\ttfamily Remote\+Fetcher}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15881}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Extracted File Modes}{Extracted File Modes}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15881}
Files are extracted with a mode matching the following formula\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{(\ (tarball\ entry\ mode\ value)\ |\ (minimum\ mode\ option)\ )\ \string~\ (umask)}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is in order to prevent unreadable files or unlistable directories from cluttering a project\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} folder, even if the package tarball specifies that the file should be inaccessible.

It also prevents files from being group-\/ or world-\/writable without explicit opt-\/in by the user, because all file and directory modes are masked against the {\ttfamily umask} value.

So, a file which is {\ttfamily 0o771} in the tarball, using the default {\ttfamily fmode} of {\ttfamily 0o666} and {\ttfamily umask} of {\ttfamily 0o22}, will result in a file mode of {\ttfamily 0o755}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{(0o771\ |\ 0o666)\ =>\ 0o777}
\DoxyCodeLine{(0o777\ \string~\ 0o22)\ =>\ 0o755}

\end{DoxyCode}


In almost every case, the defaults are appropriate. To respect exactly what is in the package tarball (even if this makes an unusable system), set both {\ttfamily dmode} and {\ttfamily fmode} options to {\ttfamily 0}. Otherwise, the {\ttfamily umask} config should be used in most cases where file mode modifications are required, and this functions more or less the same as the {\ttfamily umask} value in most Unix systems.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15882}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Extracted File Ownership}{Extracted File Ownership}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15882}
When running as {\ttfamily root} on Unix systems, all extracted files and folders will have their owning {\ttfamily uid} and {\ttfamily gid} values set to match the ownership of the containing folder.

This prevents {\ttfamily root}-\/owned files showing up in a project\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily node\+\_\+modules} folder when a user runs {\ttfamily sudo npm install}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15883}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Manifests}{Manifests}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15883}
A {\ttfamily manifest} is similar to a {\ttfamily package.\+json} file. However, it has a few pieces of extra metadata, and sometimes lacks metadata that is inessential to package installation.

In addition to the common {\ttfamily package.\+json} fields, manifests include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+resolved} The tarball url or file path where the package artifact can be found.
\item {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+from} A normalized form of the spec passed in as an argument.
\item {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+integrity} The integrity value for the package artifact.
\item {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+id} The canonical spec of this package version\+: name\begin{DoxyVersion}{Version}
.
\end{DoxyVersion}

\item {\ttfamily manifest.\+dist} Registry manifests (those included in a packument) have a {\ttfamily dist} object. Only {\ttfamily tarball} is required, though at least one of {\ttfamily shasum} or {\ttfamily integrity} is almost always present.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily tarball} The url to the associated package artifact. (Copied by Pacote to {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+resolved}.)
\item {\ttfamily integrity} The integrity SRI string for the artifact. This may not be present for older packages on the npm registry. (Copied by Pacote to {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+integrity}.)
\item {\ttfamily shasum} Legacy integrity value. Hexadecimal-\/encoded sha1 hash. (Converted to an SRI string and copied by Pacote to {\ttfamily manifest.\+\_\+integrity} when {\ttfamily dist.\+integrity} is not present.)
\item {\ttfamily file\+Count} Number of files in the tarball.
\item {\ttfamily unpacked\+Size} Size on disk of the package when unpacked.
\item {\ttfamily signatures} Signatures of the shasum. Includes the keyid that correlates to a \href{https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/keys}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily key from the npm registry}}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md15884}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Packuments}{Packuments}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md15884}
A packument is the top-\/level package document that lists the set of manifests for available versions for a package.

When a packument is fetched with {\ttfamily accept\+: application/vnd.\+npm.\+install-\/v1+json} in the HTTP headers, only the most minimum necessary metadata is returned. Additional metadata is returned when fetched with only {\ttfamily accept\+: application/json}.

For Pacote\textquotesingle{}s purposes, the following fields are relevant\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily versions} An object where each key is a version, and each value is the manifest for that version.
\item {\ttfamily dist-\/tags} An object mapping dist-\/tags to version numbers. This is how {\ttfamily foo@latest} gets turned into {\ttfamily foo@1.\+2.\+3}.
\item {\ttfamily time} In the full packument, an object mapping version numbers to publication times, for the {\ttfamily opts.\+before} functionality.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Pacote adds the following field, regardless of the accept header\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+content\+Length} The size of the packument. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
