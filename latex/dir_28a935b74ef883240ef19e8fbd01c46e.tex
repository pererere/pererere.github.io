\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Browser-\/friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.\+js \href{http://nodejs.org/api/util.html\#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor}{\texttt{ inherits}}.

This package exports standard {\ttfamily inherits} from node.\+js {\ttfamily util} module in node environment, but also provides alternative browser-\/friendly implementation through \href{https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901}{\texttt{ browser field}}. Alternative implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone module to avoid requiring of {\ttfamily util}. It also has a shim for old browsers with no {\ttfamily Object.\+create} support.

While keeping you sure you are using standard {\ttfamily inherits} implementation in node.\+js environment, it allows bundlers such as \href{https://github.com/substack/node-browserify}{\texttt{ browserify}} to not include full {\ttfamily util} package to your client code if all you need is just {\ttfamily inherits} function. It worth, because browser shim for {\ttfamily util} package is large and {\ttfamily inherits} is often the single function you need from it.

It\textquotesingle{}s recommended to use this package instead of `require(\textquotesingle{}util').inherits\`{} for any code that has chances to be used not only in node.\+js but in browser too.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md18939}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{usage}{usage}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md18939}

Version \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible neither with 2.\+0 nor with standard node.\+js {\ttfamily inherits}.

If you are using version \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}1.0 and planning to switch to \texorpdfstring{$\sim$}{\string~}2.0, be careful\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item new version uses {\ttfamily super\+\_\+} instead of {\ttfamily super} for referencing superclass
\item new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any existing fields on it 
\end{DoxyItemize}
