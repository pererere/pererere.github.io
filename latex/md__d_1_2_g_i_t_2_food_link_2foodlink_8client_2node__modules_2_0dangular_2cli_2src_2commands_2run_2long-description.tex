Architect is the tool that the CLI uses to perform complex tasks such as compilation, according to provided configurations. The CLI commands run Architect targets such as {\ttfamily build}, {\ttfamily serve}, {\ttfamily test}, and {\ttfamily lint}. Each named target has a default configuration, specified by an {\ttfamily options} object, and an optional set of named alternate configurations in the {\ttfamily configurations} object.

For example, the {\ttfamily serve} target for a newly generated app has a predefined alternate configuration named {\ttfamily production}.

You can define new targets and their configuration options in the {\ttfamily architect} section of the {\ttfamily angular.\+json} file which you can run them from the command line using the {\ttfamily ng run} command.
