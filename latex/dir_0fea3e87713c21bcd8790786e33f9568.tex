Karma is not a testing framework, nor an assertion library. Karma just launches an HTTP server, and generates the test runner HTML file you probably already know from your favourite testing framework. So for testing purposes you can use pretty much anything you like. There are already plugins for most of the common testing frameworks\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine}{\texttt{ Jasmine}}
\item \href{https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-mocha}{\texttt{ Mocha}}
\item \href{https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit}{\texttt{ QUnit}}
\item and \href{https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:karma-adapter}{\texttt{ many others}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you can\textquotesingle{}t find an adapter for your favourite framework, don\textquotesingle{}t worry and write your own. It\textquotesingle{}s not that hard and we are here to help.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md12615}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Which Browsers can I use?}{Which Browsers can I use?}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md12615}

Throughout the development of \href{https://angularjs.org/}{\texttt{ Angular\+JS}}, we\textquotesingle{}ve been using \href{https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/}{\texttt{ JSTD}} for testing. I really think that JSTD is a great idea. Unfortunately, we had many problems with JSTD, so we decided to write our own test runner based on the same idea. We wanted a simple tool just for executing Java\+Script tests that is both stable and fast. That\textquotesingle{}s why we use the awesome \href{https://socket.io/}{\texttt{ Socket.\+io}} library and \href{https://nodejs.org/}{\texttt{ Node.\+js}}.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md12623}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{My boss wants a license.
